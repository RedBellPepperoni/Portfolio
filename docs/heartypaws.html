There are a few pet care platforms in the market that offer services for new pet users and owners with multiple pets. According the the conducted research, most users feel overwhelmed by the complexity of the current available pet care platforms.
                <br><br>The idea was to create a pet care plat form that provided customized care for pet owners while also having an option to book vet and grooming appointments from the same platform. </p>
