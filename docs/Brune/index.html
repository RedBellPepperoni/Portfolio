            <p class="general-description color-text-secondary "> Brune is a first person adventure game where the protagonist is a spy who has to find out about the secrets hidden in a small european town.
                <br><br> This game was my introduction to Unreal and my main focus was game design and Lighting.
                <br> All the 3D models were made from scratch in Blender and textured using Substance painter</p>

            <p class="general-description color-text-secondary ">The gameplay features a small explorable level set in Italy. The player loses comms with the HQ and needs to venture out in the night to fix it. The game showcases various gameplay features that I implemented while learning Unreal.
                <br><br>Theres a Phone system (heavily inspired from GTA 5) where the player can open apps and take photos. Theres a basic inventory system using which the player can cycle through different items. The most notable feature is the Lock picking (inspired from Elder scrolsl and Fallout).

            <p class="general-description color-text-secondary ">The Inspiration of this game came from a small maze that i wanted to use as my level. I used minecraft to prototype different settings (a zombie filled supermarket) and finalized on a quiet european town.
                <br><br> The idea and vibe of the town was inspired from Counter Strike's Inferno and Italy levels (I wanted a non-combat way to explore these levels). Once the basic layout was finished I used Blender to start modelling all the details that were needed.

            <p class="general-description color-text-secondary ">For this project I was super focused on getting the Baked lighting right. Countless hours of experimentations were used to get a cozy feeling.
                <br><br> The final lighting is a blend of unreal's baked lighting and some custom decals for agressive shadows. I do feel the light looks samey all over the place, but as a first Unreal Project I am happy with it.
